# Machine-Learning-for-3D-Geometry
It is the course of **Machine Learning for 3D Geometry (IN2392)** from TU Munich.  
## 1. How to run this project?
In the `SoftPool` dir and the `MSN` dir, there are two `README.md`, Please read them:  
- `MSN` is the main place to run the code, you should `make` and `install` three modules and then run the train and validation python files;  
- `SoftPool`: Just install it and you will use this module in MSN.  
## 2. Dataset
In the `MSN/data_pre`, you will find the way to handle the data. Please prepare a large space (better about 100 GB) for it. 
A GPU environment is preferred as blender may accelerate via GPU.
